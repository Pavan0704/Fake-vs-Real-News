This project aims to build a fake news detection model using machine learning. It involves loading and preprocessing text data from two datasets (fake and true news), cleaning the text by performing lemmatization and removing stopwords, and then training a RandomForestClassifier model using TF-IDF vectorized features. The goal is to classify news articles as either fake or true based on their text content.
